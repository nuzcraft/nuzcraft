- 👋 Hi, I’m @nuzcraft
- 👀 I’m interested in messing around with games programming and participating in game jams
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Godot
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much. I'm not super reliable to continue with projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ... uhh, mastodon maybe? mastodon.gamedev.place/@nuzcraft. I'm not very active but would probably catch a mention.
