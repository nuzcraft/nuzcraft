- 👋 Hi, I’m @nuzcraft
- 👀 I’m interested in messing around with little programming projects that I never finish :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning js, pico-8, Python, idk
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much. I'm not super reliable to continue with projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ... uhh, twitter maybe? @nuzcraft. I'm not very active but would probably catch a mention.
